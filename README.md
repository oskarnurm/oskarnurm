## Experience

Hi, I'm Oskar, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man fan, not a fan of spiders. I have 8 months of software developer experience, which I am legally and spiritually not allowed to talk about due to an NDA. Currently adjusting the tent on my ortholinear split keyboard for the 5th time today, not out of procrastination, but because the body must flow like water. Specialized in bird law. I do my own stunts. 



## Currently Learning
- Containerized ambiguity
- Quantum UX/UI vibes
- Tactical spaghetti (both code and edible)
- Mid-level chaos orchestration
- AI for detecting AI for detecting AI
- Spite-driven deployment
- How to hold two conflicting truths and still ship on time
